# Keeper Notes

Keeper Notes is a simple React frontend-only web application for managing notes. It allows to create, edit, and delete notes while providing a seamless and responsive user interface.

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
